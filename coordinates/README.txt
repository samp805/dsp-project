Inside this directory will be files for each character that we'll encounter. 
For instance, we'll most certainly encounter the letter "a". For that letter 
we'll have a file named "a.json" that will list all of the time and frequency 
coordinates we'll need to hit to construct the letter. Take a look at example.json


NOTE: We should probably auutomate this, or else it'll take up a buncha time
